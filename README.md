<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hi, I'm L.E. Nichols and I wanted to create this resource of portfolio projects to help new and current developers who need experience in the front end. I also wanted to build this resource for developers who want to build their portfolio and have working work and code samples that actually live in their github repositories.

If you're a developer, new or old, this list of projects will help build your skills as well as prepare you for take home exams that some companies may send you as a part of their interview process. The purposes of this list is broader and can vary depending on your use case.

Here are some examples of use cases for this list of projects:
* Wanting to build your github with real life code samples
* You want build your portfolio
* You have the desire to learn frontend and clientside development primarily in Javascript
* The need to learn different frameworks
* You are preparing for possible take-home project as part of a development interview
* You desire to challenge yourself and take on some side projects to show off to your friends :smile:

Regardless of what you plan on doing with the FEPP List, its here to serve all your frontend code challenge needs! Drop me a line at <a href="mailto=lenicholsdev@gmail.com">lenicholsdev@gmail.com</a> with your success stories.

### Frontend Built With

Most of the projects listed here use Vanilla Javascript or ES6 and there are also some frameworks/libraries specific projects that use REACT / ANGULAR / VUE and others. This is good if you want to learn new tools/frameworks/libraries which are most common in the frontend. Here's a list of the most common ones you may want to study up on to complete some of the projects in the list.

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To begin, in the code above, you will see various folders with projects within them. Click on the folder and you will see the `README` for that project. Follow the readme to complete the project.

If there are any assets or images required for your project, they will be available as a `.zip` file within that project folder. Just click on the link in the readme and download them.

### Prerequisites

Each project will have their own prerequisites if any. See the projects `README` for clarity.

### Installation

_I don't suggest you clone/download this repo because it's easier to read in gitHub but in the event you want to just to have it handy and local, here's how._

1. Open up terminal and `cd` to where you want this project to live on your computer
2. `mkdir myfeppfolder` to create a new directory then `cd` into that new folder you created
3. Clone the repo
